# Java-Guess-the-5-Digit-Code

Basically, you have to guess a 5-digit, randomly generated, passcode. If any of the numbers are correct, the program will tell you how many of the digits are in the correct spot, and the sum of those digits. This Java program demonstrates the use of the Random class.
It's tough, but there is definitely a strategy to it, so don't give up if you run out of chances. Enjoy!
